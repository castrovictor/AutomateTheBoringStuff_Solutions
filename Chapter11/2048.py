"""2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down,
left, or right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score
by repeatedly sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over
again. Write a program that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulli
.github.io/2048/ and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to
automatically play the game."""
